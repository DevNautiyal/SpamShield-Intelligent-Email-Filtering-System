Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning:-
Overview-

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to automatically classify emails as spam or legitimate (ham). The system uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess email text and machine learning algorithms to detect patterns commonly found in spam messages.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the practical application of supervised learning in solving real-world text classification problems.

Features-

Text preprocessing and cleaning

Feature extraction using TF-IDF

Training and testing machine learning models

Performance evaluation using standard metrics

Prediction of new email messages

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Dataset

The model is trained on a labeled email dataset containing spam and non-spam messages. The dataset is preprocessed before training to improve accuracy and performance.

Project Workflow

Data collection and loading

Data preprocessing and text cleaning

Feature extraction using TF-IDF

Model training (Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Prediction on new email samples

How to Run the Project

Clone the repository

Install required libraries

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


Open the Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook


Run all cells to train and test the model

Results

The trained model successfully classifies emails as spam or legitimate with good accuracy. Performance is evaluated using confusion matrix and classification metrics.

Future Improvements

Deploy the model using a web interface

Improve accuracy with advanced NLP techniques

Test on larger real-world datasets
